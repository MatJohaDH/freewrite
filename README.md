# Freewrite

A smallscale script that implements the idea of **freewriting** from the book
*Writing without teachers* Elbox (197X).
In short the point is to write for 10 minutes without interruption, the
emphasis is on keeping writing rather than on what you write. As one is to keep
on writing, there is no time to read what is written nor to go back and make
any corrections. Mistakes in spelling, grammar, syntax etc. are to be be ignored
during the writing part of the session. Keep going.
